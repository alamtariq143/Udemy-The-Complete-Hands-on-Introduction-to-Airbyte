# Udemy-The-Complete-Hands-on-Introduction-to-Airbyte

This guide explains how to configure a BigQuery destination in Airbyte to replicate data from Google Sheets.

#### Prerequisites:

An Airbyte instance (self-hosted or Cloud)
A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with BigQuery enabled
A Google Sheet containing the data you want to transfer
A billing account associated with your GCP project (optional: free tier available)
Steps:

#### Ensure Billing for BigQuery:

If your GCP project doesn't have a billing account linked, navigate to the Google Cloud Console's navigation menu and select "Billing."
Click "Link a billing account" and choose the appropriate account. If necessary, create a new one from "Manage billing accounts."
Make sure your chosen project is selected and copy its project ID for later use.
Create a BigQuery Dataset:

Go to the GCP Console, navigate to "BigQuery" -> "BigQuery Studio."
Click the three dots (...) and select "Create dataset."
Provide a name for the dataset (e.g., "customers") and choose a region (e.g., "us"). Click "Create Dataset."
Configure the BigQuery Destination in Airbyte:

In Airbyte, select "BigQuery" as the destination connector.
Paste the copied project ID into the appropriate field.
Set the "Dataset Location" to the chosen region (e.g., "us") and the "Dataset ID" to the dataset name (e.g., "customers").
Choose Loading Method:

Recommended: Select "Google Cloud Storage" as the loading method for efficient data transfer.
Alternative (for testing): Choose "Insert data directly into BigQuery" (not recommended for production as it bypasses Google Cloud Storage).
Specify Service Account Key (if using "Insert data directly..."):

Locate the service account key you generated earlier for Airbyte. Copy and paste it into the corresponding field.
Verify the Connection:

Click the "Check" button in Airbyte to verify the connection configuration.
Configure Data Source Schema:

Once the connection is verified, Airbyte will fetch the schema of your Google Sheets data source. You can then configure the data transformation as needed.
Additional Notes:

For production environments, always use Google Cloud Storage as the loading method for optimal BigQuery performance and cost-effectiveness.
Refer to Airbyte's documentation for detailed instructions on data transformation and synchronization scheduling.
By following these steps, you'll have successfully established a BigQuery destination in Airbyte and prepared to replicate data from your Google Sheets into BigQuery.
